## Description 
videoPainting is a creative technique that combines elements of traditional visual art, like painting or drawing, with the dynamic and time-based qualities of video. Through a synthesis of visual and temporal elements, one can create abstract compositions that tap into the universal and deeply personal aspects of the human emotional experience. Each design is an encapsulated moment of experience used to terraform new planes of understanding. 

## Background

<img height="50%" width="50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cskonopka/syncretism-network/main/assets/vp-background.webp"/>

In the ever-evolving landscape of media art, analog video stands as a testament to the transformative power of technological mediums in their most rudimentary forms. Analog video art has a unique aesthetic and texture that differs from digital processes. It allows artists to have a hands-on connection to their work. 

Analog video synthesizers act as a conduit for the transference of innermost emotions, perceptions, and experiences onto a visual medium. Drawing parallels to the process of osmosis, where solvents pass through a semi-permeable membrane until equilibrium is achieved, this project posits that analog video synthesis can serve as a medium for “psychological osmosis.”

Viewers, when immersed in these synthesized visuals, undergo a form of perceptual osmosis. The abstract nature of analog video art allows viewers to superimpose their own experiences, feelings, and memories onto the work. This can lead to a shared, yet deeply personal, experiential space.

The goal of the project is to use analog video synthesis as a bridge, connecting the psychological inner worlds of both creator and observer, achieving a unique equilibrium in artistic expression and perception.

### What is a video synthesizer?

"A video synthesizer is a device that electronically creates a video signal. A video synthesizer is able to generate a variety of visual material without camera input through the use of internal video pattern generators. It can also accept and "clean up and enhance" or "distort" live television camera imagery. The synthesizer creates a wide range of imagery through purely electronic manipulations. This imagery is visible within the output video signal when this signal is displayed. The output video signal can be viewed on a wide range of conventional video equipment, such as TV monitors, theater video projectors, computer displays, etc." - Wiki

### What are videoPaintings?

videoPainting is a project of one-of-a-kind visual textures created using analog video synthesizers. Evolving organically, each design is an encapsulated moment of experience used to terraform new planes of understanding. Humans store the experience of time in their own unique format by generating a memory and compiling all the internal and external senses. During the archival process of creating new memories, there is a significant amount of discarded nuance. These free-floating threads of minutia hold the potential choice of mindfully engaging unaltered emotional abstractions through creating personal coincidental attachment.

### What does this mean?
Imagery cannot be replicated. If you don't capture it, it's gone forever.

### Recall Marbles (RMBs)

<img height="30%" width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cskonopka/syncretism-network/main/assets/vp-rmb.webp"/>

Every title is a description of a recent life experience captured using an analog video synthesizer. It is called a RMB or recall marble. From the initial life experience, there is a 1-3 day window where the RMB’s are accessible. Outside the window, the probability of connecting to an RMB to access the underlying memory decreases significantly, or is not possible. The only way to RMB’s outside of the window is through live improvised performance. The downside is there is no way to know if you can to connect to an RMB and there is no way of knowing which RMB you are accessing.

## Titles

The analog video synthesizer depicts the experience, and each title is an architected synopsis of that experience. The project strives to find unfamiliar words and do its best to not duplicate words. A variety of Thesauruses are used to create uniquely phrased experiences. 

| Templates    | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| v001         | (A + B) = (word + word)            |
| v002         | (A + B) = (defined phrase + defined phrase) |
| v003         | A + (B + C) = defining the subject + (subject action + nested experience within the subject's action) |
| v004         | A + (B + C) + (A + C) |

### v001
<img height="50%" width="50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cskonopka/syncretism-network/main/assets/splittingCenotaph.png"/>

(A + B) = (word + word)

splittingCenotaph =  (splitting + Cenotaph)

#### Breakdown v001
- splitting (n): The action of dividing or being divided into parts.
- cenotaph (n): A monument to someone buried elsewhere, especially one commemorating people who died in a war.

#### Synopsis v001
The video depicts an abstraction representation of a war monument splitting apart.


### v002 
<img height="50%" width="50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cskonopka/syncretism-network/main/assets/tryingtomeetinthemiddleWhenBothPartiesAreAbsorbedByPropaganda.webp"/>

(A + B) = (defined phrase + defined phrase)

tryingtomeetinthemiddleWhenBothPartiesAreAbsorbedByPropaganda = (trying to meet in the middle) + (When Both Parties Are Absorbed By Propaganda)

#### Breakdown v002
- A: Describing an action (A) that is dependent on another action or compromise
- B: Describing a scenario where (A) is dependent on the outcome 

#### Synopsis v002
It is a commentary on the impact of propaganda on individual intra-relationships psychology in modern America.


### v003
<img height="50%" width="50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cskonopka/syncretism-network/main/assets/windstructureddrapesMovingAroundUnfoundedAndMisspokenEmotions.png"/>

A + (B + C) = defining the subject + (subject action + nested experience within the subject's action) 

windstructureddrapesMovingAroundUnfoundedAndMisspokenEmotions = wind structured drapes + (Moving Around Unfounded) + (And Misspoken Emotions)

#### Breakdown v003
- A: Defining the subject
- B: The subject's action 
- C: The abstracted emotion nested within the action of the subject

#### Synopsis v003
The video is describing a set of tall drapes being moved by the wind, representing their disconnection from emotion and humans. The subject looks deeper into the movement and reflecting on their own life scenario, yearning for that untethered feeling of clarity.

### v004 (WIP)

## Patching & Performance
No prior intent or forethought of shape and color, patching is a fluid process where you trust yourself to fail, continuing to learn your inward momentum and harnessing it. The instrument requires a sense of egoless collaboration, allowing it to lead the visualization of the journey and the user provides guidance for visual manifestation. Navigating the real-time input can provide directions of focus, or emotions, to recharge the manifestation process. There is an increased possibility of reaching an inner zone of intuition that lives inside this waypoint. The waypoint is the clairvoyant center of the emotion and, if timed correctly, the user can directly experience the emotions of another. When this happens, the intensity of the experience can disrupt an individual if they are not ready. It is all-encompassing, only understood at the moment.

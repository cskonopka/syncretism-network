# cathodeSemiotics

*cathodeSemiotics* is a creative technique that combines elements of traditional visual art, like painting or drawing, with the dynamic and time-based qualities of video. Through a synthesis of visual and temporal elements, one can create abstract compositions that tap into the universal and deeply personal aspects of the human emotional experience. Each design is an encapsulated moment of experience used to terraform new planes of understanding.

| [videoPainting](https://github.com/cskonopka/syncretism-network/blob/main/videoPainting.md)    | By utilizing analog video synthesis, individuals can translate complex data into visual and auditory patterns, facilitating the clairvoyant perception of underlying trends and connections in real-time data streams. | Through the integration of analog video synthesizer technology, individuals immerse themselves in a visually and audibly stimulating environment, fostering heightened states of awareness. As participants engage with the dynamic interplay of colors, shapes, and frequencies generated by the synthesizer, they experience a deepening of intuitive perception. This clairvoyant osmosis facilitates the reception of subtle energies and insights, transcending ordinary sensory boundaries and enriching the individual's understanding of the interconnectedness of existence.            | <img height="100%" width="100%" src="https://github.com/cskonopka/syncretism-network/blob/main/assets/vp-itsAllJustLight.gif"/> | NA | NA | Avalanche |

# videoPainting

## Description 
videoPainting is a creative technique that combines elements of traditional visual art, like painting or drawing, with the dynamic and time-based qualities of video. Through a synthesis of visual and temporal elements, one can create abstract compositions that tap into the universal and deeply personal aspects of the human emotional experience. Each design is an encapsulated moment of experience used to terraform new planes of understanding.

## Background
In the ever-evolving landscape of media art, analog video stands as a testament to the transformative power of technological mediums in their most rudimentary forms. Analog video art has a unique aesthetic and texture that differs from digital processes. It allows artists to have a hands-on connection to their work. 

Analog video synthesizers act as a conduit for the transference of innermost emotions, perceptions, and experiences onto a visual medium. Drawing parallels to the process of osmosis, where solvents pass through a semi-permeable membrane until equilibrium is achieved, this project posits that analog video synthesis can serve as a medium for “psychological osmosis.”

Viewers, when immersed in these synthesized visuals, undergo a form of perceptual osmosis. The abstract nature of analog video art allows viewers to superimpose their own experiences, feelings, and memories onto the work. This can lead to a shared, yet deeply personal, experiential space.

The goal of the project is to use analog video synthesis as a bridge, connecting the psychological inner worlds of both creator and observer, achieving a unique equilibrium in artistic expression and perception.

### What is a video synthesizer?

"A video synthesizer is a device that electronically creates a video signal. A video synthesizer is able to generate a variety of visual material without camera input through the use of internal video pattern generators. It can also accept and "clean up and enhance" or "distort" live television camera imagery. The synthesizer creates a wide range of imagery through purely electronic manipulations. This imagery is visible within the output video signal when this signal is displayed. The output video signal can be viewed on a wide range of conventional video equipment, such as TV monitors, theater video projectors, computer displays, etc." - Wiki 

### What are videoPaintings?

videoPainting is a project of one-of-a-kind visual textures created using analog video synthesizers. Evolving organically, each design is an encapsulated moment of experience used to terraform new planes of understanding. Humans store the experience of time in their own unique format by generating a memory and compiling all the internal and external senses. During the archival process of creating new memories, there is a significant amount of discarded nuance. These free-floating threads of minutia hold the potential choice of mindfully engaging unaltered emotional abstractions through creating personal coincidental attachment.

## Recall Marbles (RMBs)

IMAGE

Every title is a description of a recent life experience captured using an analog video synthesizer. It is called a RMB or recall marble. From the initial life experience, there is a 1-3 day window where the RMB’s are accessible. Outside the window, the probability of connecting to an RMB to access the underlying memory decreases significantly, or is not possible. The only way to RMB’s outside of the window is through live improvised performance. The downside is there is no way to know if you can to connect to an RMB and there is no way of knowing which RMB you are accessing.

### What does this mean?
Imagery cannot be replicated. If you don't capture it, it's gone forever.

## Titles

The analog video synthesizer depicts the experience, and each title is an architected synopsis of that experience. The project strives to find unfamiliar words and do its best to not duplicate words. A variety of Thesauruses are used to create uniquely phrased experiences. 

### Designs
- v001 --> (A + B) = (word + word)
- v002 --> (A + B) = (defined phrase + defined phrase)
- v003 --> A + (B + C) = defining the subject + (subject action + nested experience within the subject's action) 
- v004 --> A + (B + C) + (A + C)

#### v001

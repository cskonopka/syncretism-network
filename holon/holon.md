# holon

*holon* reflects the holistic process of translating individual memories using digital techniques and creating a network of synthesized recollections. It embodies the notion that memory synthesis is not simply an isolated process, but a dynamic collaboration of individual consciousness & the surrounding environment.

| Mimesis      | Creating digitized banks of human memories to generate synthetic memories. | Mimesis is a framework for combining memories from a person and merging them with an upcycled computer to create a new set of synthetic memories. The upcycled computer, equipped with individualistic processing capabilities, absorbs and integrates the digitalized human memories into its existing databanks. This process combines elements of memory, emotion, and creativity, envisioning a unique and abstract way to record and visually experience personal memories through the lens of GLSL shaders.           |   <img height="100%" width="100%" src="https://github.com/cskonopka/syncretism-network/blob/main/assets/holon-mimesis.png"/> | [Medium](https://medium.com/@gg.the.garbage.man.gg/mimesis-creating-synthetic-memory-nfts-using-glsl-shaders-the-likeness-of-found-machines-28d05e0b8a84) |

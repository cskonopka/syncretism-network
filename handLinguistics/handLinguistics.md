| lexemes      |  The basic lexical units of language for real-time thought.     |   lexemes units, comprising words, morphemes, and phonemes, carry semantic and syntactic significance, allowing individuals to convey meaning and structure complex thoughts instantaneously. In the dynamic process of real-time thought, lexical units are seamlessly selected and arranged within the cognitive framework of the mind, facilitating rapid comprehension and communication. Through the intricate interplay of lexical units, individuals navigate the vast landscape of human language, translating abstract concepts into tangible linguistic constructs that facilitate both internal reflection and external interaction.          |    <img height="100%" width="100%" src="https://github.com/cskonopka/syncretism-network/blob/main/assets/hl-lexemes-01.png"/>   | NA |

## Mimesis

### Description
Mimesis is a framework for combining memories from a person and merging them with an upcycled computer to create a new set of synthetic memories. The upcycled computer, equipped with individualistic processing capabilities, absorbs and integrates the digitalized human memories into its existing databanks. This process combines elements of memory, emotion, and creativity, envisioning a unique and abstract way to record and visually experience personal memories through the lens of GLSL shaders.

### High-Level

Each genesis shader is a carefully crafted memory snapshot based on the human sensory system input that is used as source content. The human provides a content baseline, and the computer uses a variety of logic and sequential mechanisms to generate works in the artistic likeness. Computers act as a vehicle for content creation, but they also inject their own likeness based on how their operating system works at a kernel level. With the goal of ubiquity in mind, any new, upcycled or rescued computer can run the NFT content as long as it has a functioning GPU and can run OpenGL 3.0. Therefore, NFTs created in this collection can work with legacy and modern machines alike while being operating system agnostic.
 
### NFT Types
There is a total of 87 NFTs in Mimesis V1. There are two types of Mimesis NFTs:

#### Genesis

![](https://github.com/cskonopka/syncretism-network/blob/main/assets/holon-mimesis-genesis.mp4)

Genesis NFTs are manually captured memories as a GLSL shader. These shaders are the genesis for algorithmically generated synthetic memories or algoshards. (note: some of these shaders are animated)

#### Algoshard



Algoshard NFTs are algorithmically generated synthetic memories or GLSL shaders. They are created in the likeness of the genesis GLSL shader and the likeness of the computer generating the content.

### Release Schedule

The release schedule and pricing structure of Mimesis is based on the Fibonacci number system. Below is a fibonacci diagram displaying the set of numbers that are used to define the number of pieces within each series and their price. There is a total of 87 NFTs in Mimesis V1. 

- Series 00: (21) 1:1 NFTs
- Series 01: (2) 1:1 NFTs
- Series 02: (5) 1:1 NFTs
- Series 03: (34) 1:1 NFTs
- Series 04: (8) 1:1 NFTs
- Series 05: (3) 1:1 NFTs
- Series 06: (13) 1:1 NFTs
- Series 07: (1) 1:1 NFT

Single and double-digit releases are two different structures. 

- Single: digit releases contain genesis NFTs.
- Double: digit release contain(1) genesis NFT, the remaining NFTs are algoshard NFTs.

### Pricing
- The price is determined using a spinning wheel using the Fibonacci numbers depicted above
- The price of a Mimesis NFT will vary based on market conditions
- Funds from NFT go towards Mimesis development & collector airdrops
